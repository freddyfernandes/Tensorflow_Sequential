#Neural Network Model using TensorFlow Sequential API

##Overview
This project demonstrates the creation of a simple neural network model using the TensorFlow Sequential API for predicting customer churn. 
The dataset 'Churn.csv' is loaded using pandas, and preprocessing steps, including one-hot encoding, are performed to prepare the data for training.

##Prerequisites
Python
TensorFlow
pandas
scikit-learn

##Results
The model is trained using a simple architecture with one input layer, two hidden layers with ReLU activation, and an output layer with a sigmoid activation function. 
After training for 100 epochs, the model achieves an accuracy of 73.3% on the test set.
